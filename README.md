In 1985, while GM was under the leadership of Roger Smith, who sought to diversify the company, GMAC formed GMAC Mortgage and acquired Colonial Mortgage as well as the servicing arm of Norwest Mortgage, which included an $11 billion mortgage portfolio.[7]
In 1991, the company was forced to write-off $275 million in bad debt as part of a $436 million loss suffered from fraud committed by John McNamara, who ran a Ponzi scheme.[8]
In 1998, the company formed GMAC Real Estate.[6] In 1999, GMAC Mortgage acquired Ditech.[9] In 2000, the company formed GMAC Bank, a direct bank.[6] In 2005, the company formed GMAC ResCap as a holding company for its mortgage operations.[6]
In 2006, General Motors sold a 51% interest in GMAC to Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity firm. Also that year, GMAC sold a controlling interest of GMAC Commercial Holdings (its real estate division renamed Capmark) to Goldman Sachs, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and Five Mile Capital Partners.[10] GMAC Real Estate was sold to Brookfield Asset Management. In 2009, Capmark filed for bankruptcy and its North American loan origination and servicing business was acquired by Berkadia, a joint venture of Leucadia National and Berkshire Hathaway.[11]
On December 24, 2008, the Federal Reserve accepted the company's application to become a bank holding company.[12] In January 2009, the company shut down Nuvell Financial Services, its subprime lending division.[13][14]
As a result of losses in GMAC ResCap, the United States Department of the Treasury invested $17.2 billion in the company in 2008–2009. The Treasury sold its last stake in the company in 2014, recovering $19.6 billion from its $17.2 billion investment.[15]

Making auto financing more accessible
In the early 1920s, people looking to buy a car or truck had to pay cash or secure their own financing from banks that didn’t typically issue loans for automobiles. We made it convenient for customers to get financing right at the dealership. During the Great Depression, car manufactures began segmenting vehicles by cost, from low-price to luxury models. We introduced this pricing concept to the public with our slogan "A car for every purse and purpose."

As a result of losses in GMAC ResCap, the United States Department of the Treasury invested $17.2 billion in the company in 2008–2009. The Treasury sold its last stake in the company in 2014, recovering $19.6 billion from its $17.2 billion investment.[15]

This company offers financing without the need for the client to be present since they do not have a physical location, they also offer an application where clients can process their payments and also has a 24/7 customer service.
Although many other companies offer the same service, Ally Bank is characterized by offering financing not only for cars but also for mortgages and much more.

APIs become critical for enabling speed and time to market. Ally is focusing on searchable APIs so it has a centralized repository and minimizes relearning. The goal is not to relearn something people have already figured out at Ally, Muthukrishnan said. (chief information, data and digital officer of Ally Financial)

Ally Financial is also using zelle and python.

## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? 
(This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

There is a huge market of people that don’t know how to use a smartphone or a computer, sometimes they feel insecure because of their credit history.  Therefore it is almost impossible to reach out to those customers . I would like to have stations in malls , outlets , gas stations and many more places where you will be able to create a pre qualification draft and then go to the closer dealerships to get a car or a credit card .

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Because that way you will be increasing the portafolio plus that will be a very aggressive marketing campaign .




* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

A very nice stand with the logo of the company and  a tablet connected to internet to process the credit applications .


* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Because they will be user friendly to make it easy for the customers . The main idea is to catch as many customers as we can .
